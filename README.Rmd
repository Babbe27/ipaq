IPAQlong calculates the scores for the 'International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ)' long form. The IPAQ is an instrument to measure physical activity. The long form provides detailed information about physical activity undertaken in four domains: 1) leisure time, 2) domestic and gardening activities, 3) work-related and 4) transportation-related. IPAQ long calculates the scores based on the Guidelines for Data Processing and Analysis of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. 

The IPAQ Research Committee also recommends guidelines for data processing before computing the scores. These include data cleaning, truncation rules as well as how to deal with outliers. Please read these guidelines before using IPAQlong.
