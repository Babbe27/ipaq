IPAQlong calculates the scores for the ‘International Physical Activity
Questionnaire (IPAQ)’ long form. The IPAQ is an instrument to measure
physical activity. The long form provides detailed information about
physical activity undertaken in four domains: 1) leisure time, 2)
domestic and gardening activities, 3) work-related and 4)
transportation-related. IPAQ long calculates the scores based on the
Guidelines for Data Processing and Analysis of the International
Physical Activity Questionnaire.

The IPAQ Research Committee also recommends guidelines for data
processing before computing the scores. These include data cleaning,
truncation rules as well as how to deal with outliers. Please read these
guidelines before using IPAQlong.
